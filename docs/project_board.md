# Project Tasks Board

This markdown file mirrors the intended columns of a GitHub Projects (Kanban) board. Move tasks between sections as they progress.

## To Do

- Compose and send outreach emails to at least three academic/biotech laboratories and one funding body to introduce the project and request collaboration.
- Identify and compile a list of potential partners (BSL‑3/4 labs, biotech companies with monoclonal antibody platforms).
- Prepare draft grant applications (CEPI CAtALYSE, NIH R21, Horizon Europe Infectious Diseases).
- Convert the concept note into .docx and PDF formats; translate into English if necessary.
- Draft detailed SOPs for in vitro testing (e.g., SH‑SY5Y infection protocol, virus culture and safety).
- Set up a Kanban board (e.g., GitHub Projects or Trello) to track tasks and assign responsibilities.

## In Progress

_(Add tasks here once they have been started.)_

## Done

- Defined the project’s scientific focus on in silico screening of BBB‑penetrant small‑molecule inhibitors targeting RABV L and P proteins.
- Created a public GitHub repository with an MIT license.
- Added `README.md` describing the project, `.gitignore`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Added `docs/biography.md` with the team lead’s bio and `docs/concept.md` with the concept note.
